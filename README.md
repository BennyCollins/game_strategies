# Game Strategies Project

## main() Function:
Our main strategy for the game is our first function (red_percentage_strat). We specify a minimum fraction of remaining red cards in the deck, which is the main argument for this function. If the number of red cards remaining, divided by the total number of remaining cards, is larger than our minimum red fraction at any point, then the game is halted, the next card is turned over and we find out if we win or lose (where 1 represents a win and 0 represents a loss). If, however, the number of red cards remaining eventually decreases to 1, then the game is automatically halted and the next card that is turned over determines a win or a loss.

This code is used to execute the main() function, which takes as arguments minimum red fraction (default = 0.5) for our strategy, as well as the number of times the game is repeated (default = 100), and finally the sample size (default = 100).

This function finds the frequency of wins for each group of game repetitions, doing this n times (sample size = n) for the given minimum red fraction. The function then goes on to use this data to form a histogram, plotting binned frequencies of wins against their associated relative likelihoods. The final step for this function is to find a high-confidence interval for this histogram in order to provide a range of win frequencies that our strategy win probability is likely to fall within.

## strategy_outcome_breakdown_graph() Function:
The second argument for our red_percentage_strat function is return_index (default=False). If we set this argument to return_index=True, then the function returns the final card flipped over (win or loss) as well as this cardâ€™s index.

The other function this code can be used for is the strategy_outcome_breakdown_graph(), which takes as an argument the number of repeats for the game (default = 10000).
It is used to analyse the occurrence of each of 4 different possible outcomes of our game strategy:

1. Halts: More Than One Red Card Left (Win)
1. Halts: One Red Card Left (Win)
1. Halts: More Than One Red Card Left (Lose)
1. Halts: One Red Card Left (Lose)

The function repeats the game m times (number of repeats = m), logging each different type of outcome and adding each to the relevant count of each outcome type, using these counts to find relative frequencies. This is done for every single minimum red fraction for 0.5 up to 1.0. We then plot a graph showing how the relative frequency of each outcome type is affected by changes in the minimum red fraction used for our strategy.
